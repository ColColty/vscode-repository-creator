# vscode-repository-creator
This project consists on a vscode extension to create our project structure with all can be set in launch

## Usage
The usage of this extension is to set different project structures in a list, and we can call them from the vscode to add them to our current working folder.

When we select the proper project structure we want, if it's selected on the json, others prompts will be showed to ask us the different information to replace in the project structure.
